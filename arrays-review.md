# Arrays Review

Given the following code:

```js
var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

1. What is the element at index `0`?

1. What is the index of the element `3`?

1. What is the length of the array i.e. how many elements are in the array?

1. What is the index of the last element in the array? How does this number relate to the length of the array?

1. Write a for loop that console logs each element in the array. Refactor your code to use a foreach loop. How are they different?

Consider the following:

```js
var myArray = [2, 3, 4];
myArray.pop();
myArray.unshift(1);
console.log(myArray);
```

1. What will the code output?

1. What is the length of `myArray`?

1. What will `myArray.indexOf(2)` return?

1. What will `myArray.indexOf('2')` return?

1. Using `split` and `join` to complete the following:

```js
var myPhoneNumber = '210.867.5309';
// TODO: convert myPhoneNumber to an array that contains the area code, the
// first three digits and the last four numbers in the phone number

// TODO: convert the array back to a string the contains the phone number with
// the groups of numbers separated by dashes

// console log throughout to check your work
```
